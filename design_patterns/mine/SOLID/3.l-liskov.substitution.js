// This function should work with base class (Rect), and with every child class (Square) -  witout logic break, but:

const rect = new Rectangle(5, 10)
const square = new Square(5)

console.log(`Actual result of rect area ${rectAreadWithWidth3}. Expected result is 30 
  This is ok - width is 3, height is 10`)
console.log('********')
console.log(`Actual result of square area ${squareAreadWithWidth3}. Expected result is 25 
  This is BROKEN - width is 3, height is 5. It is not a square!`)

// This is LSP - every child should be able to replace it's parent without logic break.
// In this example - we should not inherit Square from Rectangle
