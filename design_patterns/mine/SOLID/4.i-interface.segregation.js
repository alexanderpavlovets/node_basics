// ISP - segregate (split) interfaces on different parts
// This allows to interface users implement only what they need, and avoid unnecessary implementstion, like this one:

// Also good to menion here - YAGNI = Your Aren't Going to Need Tt 

// AKA Interface in JS

class OldBadPrinter extends PrintMachine {
  constructor() {super()}
  print() {
    console.log('print')

  scan() {
    // it is old and can't scan. But we need to imlement method, because large PrintMachine interface
  }
  fax() {
    // it is old and can't fax. But we need to imlement method or throw Error, because large PrintMachine interface
    throw new Error('Not implemeted')
  }

// Solution: 

/* Just define 3 interfaces: 
  - Printer (IPrinter)
  - Scanner (IScaner)
  - Fax (IFax)
*/
